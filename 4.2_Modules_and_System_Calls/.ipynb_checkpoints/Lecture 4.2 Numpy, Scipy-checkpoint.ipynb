    "## Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of the examples so far, we defined our functions right above the code that we hoped to execute. If you have many functions, you can see how this would get messy in a hurry. \n",
    "Furthermore, part of the benefit of functions is that you can call them multiple times within a program to execute the same operations without writing them all out again. \n",
    "\n",
    "But wouldn't it be nice to share functions across programs, too? \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, working with genomic data means lots of time getting sequence out of FASTA files, and shuttling that sequence from program to program. Many of the programs we work with overlap to a significant degree, as they need to parse FASTA files, calculate evolutionary rates, and interface with our lab servers, for example -- all of which means that many of them share functions. And if the same function exists in two or more different programs, we hit the same problems that we hit before: complex debugging, decreased readability, and, of course, too much typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Modules__ solve these problems. In short, they're collections of functions and variables (and often objects, which we'll get to towards the end of the course) that are kept together in a single file that can be read and imported by any number of programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a module: the basics\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the basics, we'll go through the use of two modules, __sys__ and __math__, one of which we use almost all the time. In fact, it's a very rare program indeed that doesn't use the __sys__ module. __sys__ contains a lot of really esoteric functions, but it also contains a simple, everyday thing -- what you typed on the command line.\n",

    "## NumPy Basics\n",
    "Numerical Python is a powerful library of functions, methods, and data types we can used to analyze our data. Unforunately for those of us whose heads continue to spin in a crash-course of syntax, it also uses a different set of rules. I hope you'll understand why when you see the power and speed NumPy's data types afford us. Let's start off creating some empty arrays, which look sorta like lists, and are in fact vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "They differ in a few fundamental ways from lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arrays cannot be of mixed types. They can be all integers, floats, strings, logical (or boolean) values, or other immutable values. But they cannot be some characters, some numbers, or any other olio of data types. They also cannot contain mutable types such as lists. So, we can have a list of lists, but not an array of lists. We can, however, have an array of arrays (sortof). Which brings us to:\n",
    "2. Arrays can be multidimensional, but they must be rectangular. You can have a list of lists, where the first interior list is 3 elements long, the second 5, and the third 12, but your multidimensional array must be expressible as \"a m by n (by j by k by...) array\". I have never encountered a situation where Python says there are too many dimensions (but I've never had need beyond, maybe, 4 dimensions).\n",
    "3. We can perform vector operations on them, which can be algebraic functions (like a dot product), or simple replacements of values in slice of the array."

This is because numpy processes arrays using code written in 'low-level' languages like C or Fortran.  These languages are much more tedious to write programs in, but run much faster than a 'high-level' language like Python.  However, by using Python to call functions written by other people in low-level languages, you can get the best of both worlds.\n",

    "\n",
    "SciPy (pronounced \"Sigh Pie\") is a collection of libraries that builds on NumPy, and has lots of convenient, fast functions for working with large amounts of scientific data. It's slightly smaller than NumPy, with only 900-odd pages of documentation. That includes sections on integrating C or Fortran code into Python, which is way outside the scope of this course, but if you ever do get to the point where you need a super-efficient implementation of something, you're covered. Especially in the one-off nature of academic science, you're often better served spending less time writing code that takes longer to run, compared to spending lots and lots of time writing code that runs slightly faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [stats](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/stats.html) module of SciPy has functions for even more statistical distributions, statistical tests, and other assorted functions that a good statistician might need. As an example, let's see how we might use the [linregress](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.linregress.html#scipy.stats.linregress) function, which does a linear regression on some data. Linear regression is the process of finding a line that minimizes the sum of the square of the vertical distances from each point to the line.\n",

    "<ol>\n",
    "<li style=\"margin-bottom: 20px\"><b>Writing Mathematical Functions</b>\n",
    "    <ol>\n",
    "    <li>Write a function that accepts an array of floats as inputs. Return an array where every value of the input array has been divided by 1.5.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Use a random function (uniform or normal) to generate an array of floats. Write a function that accepts this array, and returns a list of values that are more than one standard deviation greater or less than the mean of the array.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Write a function that estimates a p-value from the exponential distribution (another distribution in numpy).  The function should take a number as an input (lets call it x), and return an estimate at the probability that a number drawn from the exponential distribution will be equal to or greater than x.  <br/><br/>To do this, generate many samples from the exponential distribution (use the default scale=1.0), count the number of samples greater than x, and divide the result by the number of samples you generated.  <br/><br/>Don't use a loop to count the number of samples greater than x.  Instead look at what happens when you use np.sum() on a boolean array, or read about the method np.count_nonzero().<br/><br/>Calling your function should look like this:<br/>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    out = my_function(3)\n",
    "print(out) #prints 0.050316 (or close to this number)\n",

    "So we had this idea that we might be able to find a periodicity in the spacing of pyrimidine residues downstream of the termination site in Rho dependent genes (by and large, we don't). Nevertheless:\n",
    "    <ol>\n",
    "    <li>Make a function that takes a DNA string as input (Only G, C, A, or T's) and an arbitrary substring (e.g. \"CT\"). The function should find all locations of the substring in the string and return it as an array.<br/><i>For Example:</i><br/>\n",

    "    <li>Find the difference between each pair of adjacent substrings. (Check if a numpy method does this?)<br/><i>For Example:</i><br/>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    differences = find_differences(a)\n",
    "# differences contains [6, 4]\n",
    "    ```</li>\n",
    "    <li>Use the fasta-parser you've written to read the S.cerevisiae genome fasta file from Lecture 1.1 . Then, using the functions in part (a) and (b), generate a full list of the spacings between 'CT' nucleotide pairs for each chromosome and return an array of the differences between adjacent positions</li>\n",
